I am a PhD student in the [Vashisth Research Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/aniruddhvashisth123/home?authuser=0) where I work on moving manufacturing technology closer to magic through the use of artificial intelligence, robots and unconventional processes. I did my Bachelor's in mechanical engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology BHU, Varnasi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/).
I am motivated and passionate about employing engineering techniques for finding solutions to problems in operations research and intelligent manufacturing. My research interests focus on applications of Robotics, Control and Instrumentation in manufacturing, operations and materials science.

I am a PhD student in the [Vashisth Research Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/aniruddhvashisth123/home?authuser=0) where I work on moving manufacturing technology closer to magic through the use of artificial intelligence, robots and unconventional processes. I did my Bachelor's in mechanical engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology BHU, Varnasi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/).
